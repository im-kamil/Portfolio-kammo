                <h2> MD KAMIL NASAR</h2>
                <P>I'm an enthusiastic learner and who is undergrad Engineering student at ZHCET, AMU ,who constantly
                    working to learn new things and improve my skills to be the best version of myself.
                    I am motivated and driven. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have
                    something to strive towards. I'm not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an
                    opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. I'm a people-person. I love meeting new people and
                    learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with
                    strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I love to take lead and to help
                    others in all possible ways I can. I'm a fellow creative soul who loves to do something new ðŸ¥².<br>
                     who loves writing code. Ever since I wrote my first program in C++
                    and got to know about concepts like Classes and objects, I have been obsessed with the idea of using
                    software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am
                    passionately engaged in solving. Android development and problem-solving call to all my passion, it
                    incorporates creativity and brain-teasing. My specialties include quickly learning new skills and
                    programming languages, and problem-solving. I love to take lead and to help others in all possible way i can

                <p> Logic turns the act of abstraction into a tool for determining what is true and what is false: truth
                    can be discovered in words alone, apart from concrete experience.</p>
